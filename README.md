## 🧠 Key Insights and Findings

1. **Passenger Volume vs Best Flight Performance:**  
Using the **Key Influencers visual**, it was observed that **as Total Passengers increase, the likelihood of a flight being categorized as "Best" also increases**.  
This shows a **direct positive relationship** between **passenger count** and **flight performance status**.

2. **Ticket Count vs Best Flights:**  
Similarly, **higher total ticket bookings** also increase the chances of flights being marked as **"Best"**.  
This indicates that **flights with higher ticket sales tend to perform better operationally and customer-wise**.

3. **Flight Status by City (Sankey Chart Insights):**
- **Houston** recorded the **highest number of ticket cancellations**.
- **Los Angeles** recorded the **highest number of confirmed tickets**.
- These insights were visualized using a **Sankey Chart**, showing the flow of bookings from **Destination to Booking Status**.
